# Submodules of `drl_grasping` module can be imported individually as needed.

# `drl_octree` - Import via `from drl_grasping import drl_octree` in order to employ a policy with an octree-based CNN feature extractor (Stable-Baselines3 algorithms).

# `drl_grasping_envs` - Import via `from drl_grasping import envs as drl_grasping_envs` to use of the environments.

# `drl_grasping_utils` - Import via `from drl_grasping import utils as drl_grasping_utils` for boilerplate scripts that simplify training and evaluation.
